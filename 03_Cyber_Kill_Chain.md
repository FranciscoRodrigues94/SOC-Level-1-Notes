## Overview

This room introduces the **Cyber Kill Chain®**, a framework developed by Lockheed Martin in 2011, adapted from military strategies to help understand and counter cyberattacks.  
It outlines the stages an adversary must go through to successfully carry out an attack, and how security professionals can disrupt the process at any point.

## Key Concepts

- The Cyber Kill Chain consists of **seven attack phases**:
  1. Reconnaissance  
  2. Weaponization  
  3. Delivery  
  4. Exploitation  
  5. Installation  
  6. Command & Control  
  7. Actions on Objectives
- The goal of defenders is to **detect and break the chain** as early as possible.
- This framework helps identify security gaps and improve system defenses against threats like **ransomware**, **data breaches**, and **advanced persistent threats (APTs)**.
- It is widely used by **SOC Analysts**, **Threat Hunters**, and **Incident Responders** to understand attacker behavior and anticipate intrusions.
- The Cyber Kill Chain is also useful for assessing existing security controls and identifying areas for improvement.

## Personal Notes

- This room helped me understand the logic behind how attackers structure their operations and why it's important to disrupt them early.
- I found the breakdown of each stage especially helpful to visualize how attackers think and move.
- It reinforced the idea that **thinking like an attacker** is key to effective defense.
- I now understand how this model can be used to strengthen a company’s security posture and improve incident response.
- Recognizing the stage of an attack helps define the right response — whether it's prevention, detection, or mitigation.
