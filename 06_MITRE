## Overview

This module introduces the main cybersecurity projects developed by **MITRE**, a US-based non-profit known for its work in national security, public interest R&D, and cybersecurity research. While many associate MITRE with the CVE list, their contributions go far beyond that. In cybersecurity, MITRE has created several essential frameworks to help organizations understand, detect, and defend against adversarial behavior.

## Key Concepts

- **MITRE ATT&CK** – A globally accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations.
- **CAR (Cyber Analytics Repository)** – A repository of analytics for detecting malicious activity, built on ATT&CK tactics.
- **MITRE ENGAGE** – Focuses on adversary engagement and deception strategies (e.g., honeypots, misdirection).
- **MITRE D3FEND** – A framework designed to map defensive techniques that can mitigate ATT&CK techniques (like an opposite of ATT&CK).
- **ATT&CK Emulation Plans (AEP)** – Structured plans for simulating real-world adversary behaviors to test and improve detection capabilities.
- These tools are complementary and can be integrated into security operations for better visibility, threat detection, and defense strategy.

## Personal Notes

- I always thought MITRE was just about CVEs, but I now understand their broader impact on cybersecurity.
- The ATT&CK Framework is incredibly valuable to map attacker behavior and build detection logic.
- CAR shows how to translate ATT&CK into real detection rules and SIEM queries.
- ENGAGE and D3FEND add new dimensions: how to **respond** and **deceive** attackers, not just detect them.
- The Emulation Plans offer hands-on practice to simulate attacks and improve SOC readiness.
