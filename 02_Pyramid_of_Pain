## Overview

This room introduces the **Pyramid of Pain**, a framework created by David Bianco to explain the effectiveness of detecting and disrupting different types of attacker indicators during an incident.  
The pyramid shows how much impact defenders can have on attackers based on the type of indicator detected — from simple artifacts like file hashes to complex behavioral patterns like TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).

## Key Concepts

- The Pyramid of Pain is made up of six levels of indicators, from easiest to hardest to change:
  1. Hash Values
  2. IP Addresses
  3. Domain Names
  4. Network/Host Artifacts
  5. Tools
  6. Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs)
- The higher you go in the pyramid, the more disruptive the detection is for the attacker.
- Detecting or blocking TTPs forces attackers to redesign their entire approach.
- Lower-level indicators (e.g., hashes) are easy for attackers to replace and offer limited defensive value on their own.

## Personal Notes

- This room helped me understand that not all indicators are equally valuable — some can truly disrupt an adversary’s operations.
- I now see how focusing on **TTP-level detection** can create friction and slow down or stop attackers entirely.
- It made me reflect on the difference between simply reacting to alerts and strategically undermining attacker behavior.
- I’ll use this model when thinking about what to prioritize in detection and response strategies.
