## Overview

The **Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis** is a framework used to analyze cyberattacks by focusing on the relationship between four key elements involved in an intrusion.  
It helps security analysts understand how attacks are structured and how the different components are connected.

## Key Concepts

The Diamond Model has four vertices:

1. **Adversary** – The threat actor behind the attack (e.g., hacker, APT group)
2. **Infrastructure** – The resources used by the adversary (e.g., C2 servers, IP addresses, domains)
3. **Capability** – The tools or malware used to perform the attack (e.g., ransomware, exploits)
4. **Victim** – The target of the attack (e.g., company, user, network)

- These elements are interconnected:  
  An **adversary** uses a **capability** through some **infrastructure** to target a **victim**.
- The model is used to identify relationships between incidents and build stronger threat intelligence.
- It supports both reactive and proactive defense strategies in SOC environments.

## Personal Notes

- This model helped me visualize the full picture of an attack — not just the tool or the target, but the whole chain.
- I understood how mapping these elements allows analysts to connect related incidents and track threat actor behavior.
- It's useful for breaking down complex intrusions and supporting both detection and strategic response.
- I can see how the Diamond Model complements frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK by adding context to attacker operations.
