Threat Intelligence Lifecycle

## Overview

The Threat Intelligence Lifecycle is a structured process used to turn raw security data into contextual, actionable insights. These insights help prioritize threats, inform responses, and strengthen security posture. 
The lifecycle consists of **six iterative phases**, ensuring intelligence remains relevant and effective.

## Key Concepts

### 1. **Direction**
- Define goals and objectives of the CTI program.
- Identify:
  - Critical assets and business processes to protect.
  - Potential impact of asset loss or interruption.
  - Trusted data sources for threat intelligence.
  - Required tools and resources for defense.
- Allows posing investigative questions to guide analysis.

### 2. **Collection**
- Gather data from commercial, private, and open-source sources.
- Due to high volume, **automation** is key to streamline triage and response.

### 3. **Processing**
- Standardize raw data (logs, malware samples, vulnerability info, etc.).
- Organize and correlate using tools like SIEMs for readability and efficiency.
- Add tags, visuals, and structure to make data analyst-friendly.

### 4. **Analysis**
- Interpret the processed data to:
  - Investigate threats and uncover IOCs or attack patterns.
  - Define action plans for response and mitigation.
  - Justify security investments or improve existing defenses.

### 5. **Dissemination**
- Share tailored intel across stakeholders:
  - Executives: Strategic reports (trends, impact, ROI).
  - Technical teams: IOCs, TTPs, mitigation plans.
- Must be in appropriate formats and levels of detail.

### 6. **Feedback**
- Collect reactions from stakeholders to evaluate effectiveness.
- Continuous communication between teams is vital.
- Enables improvement and refinement of the CTI lifecycle.

##  Personal Notes

- SIEMs are central to the **Processing** phase — helps transform messy logs into usable formats.
- The **Dissemination** phase reminds me that communication is everything — intel is useless if it’s not delivered in the right format to the right people.
- **Direction** is the foundation: asking the right questions from the start defines the quality of the entire process.
