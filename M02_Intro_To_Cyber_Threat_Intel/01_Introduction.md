# Introduction to Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

## What is this about?

This room introduces the core concepts of **Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)** and the frameworks commonly used to structure and share threat-related information. For security analysts, understanding CTI is essential to identify, report, and defend against adversaries — both within the organisation and across the wider cyber community.

---

## Learning Objectives

- Understand what CTI is and how it supports modern cybersecurity.
- Learn the **different classifications** of threat intelligence (e.g. strategic, tactical, operational, technical).
- Explore the **CTI lifecycle** — how intelligence is gathered, analyzed, and applied.
- Discover widely adopted **frameworks and standards** for sharing intelligence (such as STIX/TAXII).
- Gain awareness of open-source **CTI tools** like YARA, MISP, and OpenCTI.

## Where this fits in

This is the **first room** in the **Cyber Threat Intelligence module**, which includes the following topics:

- Threat Intelligence Tools
- YARA (pattern-based malware detection)
- OpenCTI (open-source threat intel platform)
- MISP (Malware Information Sharing Platform)

## Personal Notes (to expand as I go)

- CTI is not just about collecting threat data — it’s about turning data into **actionable insights**.
- Effective CTI helps reduce alert fatigue by enriching alerts with context and relevance.
- I want to explore how CTI helps SOC teams **prioritize** threats and **communicate risk** to leadership.

## Reflections

> As a future SOC analyst, my goal is to not just detect — but to **understand who is attacking, why, and how to respond effectively**.
