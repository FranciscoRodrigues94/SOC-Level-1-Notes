# 01 - What is Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI)

## Overview

Cyber Threat Intelligence (CTI) is the evidence-based knowledge that helps organizations understand their adversaries. It includes indicators, motivations, tactics, and actionable advice used to defend systems, inform decision-making, and strengthen cybersecurity strategies.

## Key Concepts

### Data vs Information vs Intelligence

- **Data**: Raw technical indicators (e.g., IPs, URLs, hashes).
- **Information**: Contextualized data answering specific queries.
- **Intelligence**: Correlated insights identifying patterns and adversary behavior.

### CTI Objectives

- Identify threat actors and motivations.
- Assess their capabilities and tactics.
- Detect and monitor Indicators of Compromise (IOCs).
- Strengthen defenses based on insights.

### Sources of Threat Intelligence

- **Internal**: Logs, training reports, incident response, vulnerability scans.
- **Community**: Open forums, dark web communities.
- **External**: Intel feeds, OSINT, marketplaces, public/government data.

### Threat Intelligence Classifications

- **Strategic Intelligence**: Business-level insights for leadership.
- **Technical Intelligence**: Attack artefacts and evidence for incident response.
- **Tactical Intelligence**: TTPs (Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures).
- **Operational Intelligence**: Motives, intent, and targeted assets.

## Personal Notes

- CTI is not just about collecting data — it’s about **connecting the dots** to create a defensive strategy.
- Separating data → information → intelligence helps avoid overload and focus on actionable knowledge.
- Tactical and operational intel feel the most “hands-on” for SOC work; strategic is more for leadership.
- Sources like internal logs and community forums are often overlooked but super valuable!
