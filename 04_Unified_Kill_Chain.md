## Overview

This room introduces the **Unified Kill Chain (UKC)** framework, designed to help understand the behaviors, goals, and tactics used by cyber attackers.  
The UKC provides a more comprehensive view of modern attack patterns and complements other frameworks like the MITRE ATT&CK or the Cyber Kill Chain.

## Key Concepts

- The UKC helps map attacker behavior across multiple phases and tactics — like the Cyber Kill Chain, but in a more detailed and dynamic way.  
  Unlike the traditional model, the UKC assumes that many phases of an attack overlap, so breaking them into 18 steps allows cybersecurity analysts to follow the attacker’s path more precisely.
- It supports building a strong **cybersecurity posture** by helping organizations understand how attacks unfold in a deeper and more structured manner.
- It focuses not only on the technical steps of the attack, but also the **motivation and methodology** behind them.
- The UKC can be used **in conjunction with other frameworks** such as MITRE ATT&CK to enhance threat detection, response, and analysis.

## Personal Notes

- This room helped me understand how UKC expands on the traditional Kill Chain model to better reflect modern adversary behavior.
- I learned that combining multiple frameworks (like UKC and MITRE) allows for more complete detection coverage and a stronger defense strategy.
- Thinking in terms of attacker motivation and methodology adds valuable depth to incident analysis, and can help both mitigate (blue team) and anticipate or counter attacks (red team).
- The UKC brings together both technical execution and strategic thinking, making it a powerful tool for SOC teams and threat analysts.
